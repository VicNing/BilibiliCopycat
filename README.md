##Development Platform
This project was originally developed on HTC ONE m7 Android 4.4.2.

There could be some screen compatability and Android paltform issues if you run this project on your development devices. Due to personal reasons, it hard to fix these issues on my side alone. So, if any of you meet compatability issuses, don't hesitate to contact me, with your Android platform and devices' spec.
